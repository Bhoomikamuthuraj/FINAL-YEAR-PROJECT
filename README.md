# FINAL-YEAR-PROJECT - PLAZA PLUS - AN IMPROVEMENT TO TOLL COLLECTION SYSTEM

# Abstract:

Taxes are paid to everything around us. The government collects toll taxes at toll plazas, where the vehicle needs to stop and pay the tax to travel any further. In the fiscal year 2021, approximately 15000 crores were collected as toll tax. Even though the existing toll collection has reduced the waiting time near the toll plaza, there are problems associated with it. As the number of vehicles passing through the toll plaza increases, so does the traffic near the plaza. Access to the emergency lane is limited to ambulances and VIPs, but there is no option for the common person who is in a hurry or has an emergency to use the emergency lane near the toll plaza. Our focus is to provide an option for the common people to use the emergency lane or to skip the traffic near the toll plaza. To provide this option, we use an automatic number plate recognition system with the additional feature of pre-booking toll tickets. This system addresses the issue of the vehicle owner who is in an emergency and does not have the option to skip the queue near the toll plaza.

# Proposed System: 

To provide access to the emergency lane to the common people, a system can be proposed that includes the pre-booking of the toll ticket through the website. And to overcome the issues related to the fast tag, we make use of a number plate recognition system technology.

The objective of our proposed system is to build a user-friendly website through which-

•	The vehicle owner can-

    • Create an account to access the website.
    
    • Pre-book their toll tickets and can therefore utilize the emergency lane.
    
•	The admin can-

    • Verify the information provided by the user.
    
    • Based on the information provided, the admin can accept/reject the account creation process of the user.
    
    • Can manage the information related to the tollbooths.
    
•	The toll booth manager can-

    • Alter the vehicle number, if the recognized number is wrong and allow the user to pass through the gate.
    
# Working of the proposed system:
 
• To utilize the emergency lane, the vehicle owner needs to create an account with their vehicle number.

• After submitting the request to create an account, the admin receives the request and verifies the details provided by the vehicle. The admin has the right to accept or reject the request for creating the account and the admin has also access to add toll plazas. 

• Whenever the vehicle owner wants to use the emergency lane, they can log in and pre-book the toll ticket. 

• A number plate recognition system is placed near the emergency lane of the toll plaza. Whenever a user who has pre-booked the toll comes near the emergency lane, the number plate recognition system detects the number-

    • If the number is present in the database, the toll gate opens automatically.

    • If not, the gate remains closed.
  
• And the transaction details will be sent to the user’s email id.
